This directory contains database related files

dump: dump stores topicsexplorerdump.sql, which is used to import example data to the application database
in the development environment.

postgresql-data: this is where the database data is persisted in the production environment. Since the database 
runs on a Docker container, this directory is mapped to the container's /var/lib/postgresql/data directory, 
through a Docker Compose volume.
